  <ol type="I">
    <li>Participated in scientific research of new formulation development (e.g. rice topper, puff pastry,
      gluten free dumplings, steam buns), including sourcing of new ingredients, developing prototypes
      and validating final formulations.</li>
    <li>Operated production machinery to execute complex plant trials.</li>
    <li>Maintained Good Manufacturing Practices (GMPs) and updated SOP as required.</li>
  </ol>
  <p><strong>Lab Research Assistant</strong> <em>University of Alberta, Canada</em> <strong>09/2014 â€“ 06/2019</strong></p>
  <ol type="I">
    <li>Performed analytical testing using basic laboratory equipment (scale, pipette, pH/conductivity
      meter, centrifuge, water bath, mechanical mill, homogenizer, etc.), proximate analysis (oven,
      furnace, LECO protein analyzer, Goldfisch Fat Extraction Apparatus), chromatography (e.g. HPLC,
      GC), spectrophotometry (UV-visible spectrophotometer), Infrared spectroscopy (NIR, FTIR), and
      other material property testing (e.g. texture analyzer, electron microscopy etc.).</li>
    <li>Performed proximate analysis (moisture, protein, fat, ash), fiber content (Megazyme kit), total
      carbohydrates, starch content (Megazyme kit), antioxidant activity analysis (e.g. FRAP, ABTS,
      DPPH) of various agricultural and food samples (e.g. different type of starches, potato, chitosan and
      cellulose) according to official methodology (e.g. ASTM, AOAC standards).</li>
    <li>Developed and researched new experimental methods and updated Standard Operating Procedures
      (e.g. developed, updated and standardized sample preparation and operation protocols for
      mono/poly saccharide detection in starch hydrolysates using HPLC according to AOAC Method
      985.29 and Agilent user manual, analysis of sugars in biomass hydrolysates by GC).</li>
    <li>Conducted microbiological testing, including bacteria plating, swabbing, inoculation and counting
      (e.g. tested antimicrobial activity of films on ham; works included bacteria culturing (Listeria and 5
      stains of lactic acid bacteria), inoculation of bacteria, surviving cells detection).</li>
    <li>Followed lab quality assurance procedures by entering equipment logs, conducting calibration,
      using control charts to monitor the accuracy of analysis, conducting preventive maintenance on
      equipment etc.</li>
    <li>Verified and interpreted data using Microsoft Excel, R-language, Minitab and Origin; reported
      results to the supervisor in a timely manner.</li>
    <li>Technical communication with the ability to write clearly and accurately.</li>
